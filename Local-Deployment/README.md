# Local Exareme Deployment Guide

Here you will find all the information needed in order to deploy Exareme in your environment via docker compose and shell scripts.

# Requirement

1) Install Docker in your machine.

2) Since the deployment of a local instance of Exareme involves the creation of a Docker Swarm, you need to make sure that the node has:

- Static public IP
- Network configuration:
  * TCP: ports 2377 and 7946 must be open and available
  * UDP: ports 4789 and 7946 must be open and available
  * IP protocol 50 (ESP) must be enabled

# Ports

Make sure the following ports are available:

```9090: for accessing Exareme```

```(Optional): 8500 for accessing Consul Key Value Store``` 

```(Optional): 9000 for accessing Portainer.io```

# Preparation

## Clone the repository 

Clone this repository on your local computer so you can use it to deploy Exareme.

## Data Structure
DATA should follow a specific structure. A data folder, which will be referred as  ```data_path```, should contain one
folder for each pathology that it has datasets for. Inside that folder there should be:

1) the datasets.csv file with all the datasets combined and
2) the CDEsMetadata.json file for that specific pathology.

For example:

-> Data Folder <br />
------> Dementia <br />
----------> adni.csv <br />
----------> ppmi.csv <br />
----------> CDEsMetadata.json <br />
------> Neuropathology <br />
----------> demo.csv <br />
----------> CDEsMetadata.json <br />

You should include the CDEsMetadata.json file for every pathology even if it doesn't contain a datasets.csv file.

For example:

-> Data Folder <br />
------> Dementia <br />
----------> CDEsMetadata.json <br />
------> Neuropathology <br />
----------> demo.csv <br />
----------> CDEsMetadata.json <br />

For more information on what these files should contain you can see here:

## [Optional] Exareme Version 
```This step can be done through the deploy script.```

In the ```Local-Deployment/``` folder create an ```exareme.yaml``` file.

The file should contain the following lines, modify them depending on the version of Exareme you want to deploy.

```
EXAREME_IMAGE: "hbpmip/exareme"
EXAREME_TAG: "v21.3.0"
```

## [Optional] Data path location
```This step can be done through the deploy script.```

In the ```Local-Deployment/``` folder create a ```data_path.txt``` file.

The file should contain the following line, modify it according to the path where your data folder is.

```
LOCAL_DATA_FOLDER=/home/user/data/
```

# Deployment

In the ```Local-Deployment/``` folder, run the ```deployLocal.sh``` to start the deployment.
You will be prompted to provide any information needed.

## [Optional] Secure Portainer

By default, Portainerâ€™s web interface and API are exposed over HTTP. If you want them to be exposed over HTTPS check

# Troubleshooting

While ```sudo docker service ls```, if the services are Replicated 0/1:

1) Check that you have enough space in your machine.

2) If there is an ERROR, try ```sudo docker service ps --no-trunc NAME_OR_ID_OF_SERVICE``` to see the whole message.
